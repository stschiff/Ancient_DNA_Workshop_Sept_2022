This repository contains presentations, data and code for a workshop on ancient DNA that I gave in Siegen on September 6-7, 2022.

Prerequisites.

I recommend you install [miniconda]() on your system.

To run the examples, you will need `samtools`, via `conda install -c bioconda samtools`.

For building the slides you will also need jupyter: `conda install jupyter`
