Next generation sequencing data consists of millions relatively short sequences. In case of ancient DNA, these are typically around only 50 basepairs (bp) long. 

Here is a real example of such sequences, obtained from a bone sample of an early medieval burial from Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK (Individual 12884A from \cite{Schiffels_2016})







In comparison, the human genome, of around 3 billion bp, is huge. 

To make sense of the sequencing data of a sample, all these millions of short seuqences
