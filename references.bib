               humans, lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before

               nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the
               Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from
               different parts of the world identify a number of genomic
               regions that may have been affected by positive selection in
               ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism
               and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that
               Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans
               in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa,
               suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of
               non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups

              people, and their subsequent admixture. Recently, ancient DNA has
              brought new insights into European migration events linked to the
              advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of
              Indo-European languages. However, little is known about the
              ancient population history of north-eastern Europe, in particular
              about populations speaking Uralic languages, such as Finns and
              Saami. Here we analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals
              from Finland and north-western Russia. We show that the genetic
              makeup of northern Europe was shaped by migrations from Siberia
              that began at least 3500 years ago. This Siberian ancestry was
              subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region,
              particularly into populations speaking Uralic languages today.
              Additionally, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a
              larger territory during the Iron Age, which adds to the
              historical and linguistic information about the population
              history of Finland.",

              were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west
              European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these
              populations' deep relationships and show that early European
              farmers had ∼44\% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population

  abstract  = "We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived
               between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries
               for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of
               these positions decreases the sequencing required for
               genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold,
               allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than
               previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We
               show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe
               followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At
               the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ∼8,000-7,000
               years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in
               Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous
               hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive
               population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a
               ∼24,000-year-old Siberian. By ∼6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers
               throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than
               their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of
               this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern
               European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near
               Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact
               ∼4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from
               Germany traced ∼75\% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,
               documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe
               from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in
               all sampled central Europeans until at least ∼3,000 years ago,
               and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results
               provide support for a steppe origin of at least some of the
               Indo-European languages of Europe.",
