  abstract  = "Neandertals, the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day
               humans, lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before
               disappearing 30,000 years ago. We present a draft sequence of
               the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion
               nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the
               Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from
               different parts of the world identify a number of genomic
               regions that may have been affected by positive selection in
               ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism
               and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that
               Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans
               in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa,
               suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of
               non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups
               from each other.",
