Welcome to the Website for the "Ancient DNA Data Analysis" workshop.

# Overview

## Learning objectives

# Technical prerequisites

Our interactive exercises require a mix of tools, such as [R](), [samtools](), [Eigensoft]() and [Poseidon]().

If you are an attendee of this workshop, you will have access to a [prepared RStudio-Cloud environment](#rstudio-cloud) which has all that you need ready to go. The only thing you will need is a webbrowser and an RStudio-Cloud account, see below. It is also possible to install things locally (see [How to run this workshop locally](#local-install))

## RStudio-Cloud

Our interactive exercises are done in [RStudio-Cloud](https://cloud.rstudio.com).
