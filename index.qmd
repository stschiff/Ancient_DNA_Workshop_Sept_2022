Welcome to the Website for the "Ancient DNA Data Analysis" workshop.

# Overview

## Learning objectives

# Technical prerequisites

Our interactive exercises require a mix of tools, such as [R](), [samtools](), [Eigensoft]() and [Poseidon]().

If you are an attendee of this workshop, you will have access to a [prepared RStudio-Cloud environment](#rstudio-cloud) which has all that you need ready to go. The only thing you will need is a webbrowser and an RStudio-Cloud account, see below. It is also possible to install things locally (see [How to run this workshop locally](#local-install))

## RStudio-Cloud

Our interactive exercises are done in [RStudio-Cloud](https://cloud.rstudio.com). 

In order to join our "classroom" workspace, you need to follow [this link](). Then follow these steps:

- Click on "Sign up" to create a free account, _or_, if you already have an account, simply log in
- In the workshop space, you should now see "Join Space?" -> Click "YES"
- In the top menu, click on "Projects"
- You should see a project named "Ancient_DNA_Workshop_Sept_2022". Click on "Start" right next to it.
- You should now see something like this:
